>[!Tip] I used a Pioneer MVH-S420BT that cost me $30 from FB Marketplace.

We need a headunit that allows you to control it without using the faceplate. Obviously the faceplate will still be attached, but our new screen will cover the radio. That's where [[#Smart Sync]] comes in.

# Smart Sync
First of all, Smart Sync is an amazing app developed by Pioneer. No idea why they created it to be honest. Not really sure what problem this solves for the average person, but it is very important for our highly specific use case. ***Thank you**

 
## What it does
Smart Sync gives your phone or tablet an interface for your headunit. It actually works well as a full replacement. 

> I think they developed it for the [Pioneer SPH-10BT](https://usa.pioneer/products/sph-10bt) which doesn't have a volume knob, so it might be btecause people might have a hard time changing the settings without an app?

You can control every possible setting on the headunit, and even settings that are inaccessible from the headunit (such as 31 band EQ).

Now we know what headunit to get. We will move onto what [[Tablet|Tablet to Get]]
