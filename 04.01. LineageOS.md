# Background Info
## What is an Operating System
To oversimplify: All computers need an OS (Operating System). Android devices are mobile computers. All the other apps and software you install are reliant on the Operating System to work. Since the OS is so fundamental, changing it will alter how you interact with your device. In our case, we are installing a "lightweight" version of Android that allows devices with slower processors to work better. I will use the terms "Custom ROM, OS, and Operating System" interchangeably throughout this guide. For our purposes, they mean the same thing. 

## LineageOS Experience
You can do some more research but I will give a quick rundown here:

Android is Open Source software maintained by Google.

Manufacturers will use Android and modify it's code, often leading to worse performance.

LineageOS is also Open Source. Their goal is to provide a stable version of Android that has as few modifications as possible, allowing it to be very quick. They also provide necessary patches to ensure it works on our device.

We want as few features as possible, because we will be adding them ourselves with our own apps. We shouldn't be fighting a device that wants to do its own thing.


This part is *technically* optional, but the experience would suffer.
You can also go with another Custom ROM of your choice.
