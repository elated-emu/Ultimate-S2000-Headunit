# Operating System - LineageOS
I use [[LineageOS]] to replace Samsung's version of Android. It is much snappier, happier, and doesn't beg me to login to Samsung's spyware *I mean software*. It is optional, but I highly recommend flashing [[LineageOS]] onto your device

# App Stores
## FDroid
I use FDroid to download open source apps. This is where I get most of my apps, I will only use [[#Aurora]] if there is no alternative

## Aurora
Aurora is a middleman between you and Google Play Store. It allows you to install apps from the Play Store without actually installing the Play Store.

# Automation - Tasker
>[!TIP] Tasker is a must have.
It tells your tablet to unlock and stay on while it is charging, and sleeps right when you shut off your car to simulate an actual headunit.

Tasker has many more capabilities, depending how deep you want to go with it. I kept mine pretty simple. 
1. Turn on the screen, launch the [[Pioneer Headunit#Smart Sync|Smart Sync app]] , turn on GPS / WiFi / 4G and keep the screen on when it is charging (from the USB slot of the headunit)
2. Turn off the screen when it is not receiving charge.
3. If battery is below 75%, disable WiFi, Bluetooth, 4G, GPS, and enter power saving mode

However Tasker does charge a one time fee of $4. Which I recommend purchasing through their [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/joaoapps/membership) so that you can get access to the Google free version of Tasker


# Navigation Software - OsmAnd
If you read my [[Rules to the Challenge]], you would know that I cannot use any Google software. So no Google Maps. Instead I use OsmAnd, which is fully offline maps with speeding camera notifications. When you launch it, it will suggest an area of map to download for offline use. You can then make routes anytime, even when you're offline. Works really well :)

I downloaded this from [[#FDroid]]

# Headunit Integration - Smart Sync
**[[Pioneer Headunit#Smart Sync|Smart Sync]]** is the software I keep raving about. It allows seamless integration with all the headunit configurations for audio. Very important if you care about EQ, audio processing, etc.

# Home Screen - AGAMA
Pioneer Smart Sync falls short on customisation of the home screen. Of course, it wasn't designed to completely replace a head unit. That is where AGAMA Car Launcher comes in. It is a home screen for the radio with many customization options, including the option to show a clickable Honda Logo that will automatically be replaced by your speedometer, navigation, or currently playing tracks depending on the scenario. It automatically dims the brightness depending on the sunset time. This app really gives it an OEM feel, as well as being very fluid. It has a 30 day free trial, so definitely check it out.

# Music - Spotify
Spotify works fine without Play Services, however it might warn you that you need it. This is fine to ignore.

# Movies & TV - Netflix
Netflix works fine without Play Services

# Podcasts - AntennaPod (Foss)
It is a simple Podcast app that can stream and download podcasts from various sources.
