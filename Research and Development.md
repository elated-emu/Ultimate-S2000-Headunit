Now that we know our [[Rules to the Challenge]]. We can get into the research aspect of things: Why I chose what I did, and why I rejected certain things. This will be chronological, and follow my thought process.

## Idea 1
Raspberry Pi Radio with a custom Car OS installed.
### Pros
- Fully customizable Operating System
- Ability to add physical knobs
- Somewhat cheap (but getting pricier)

### Cons
- Lackluster software options
- Mobile Compatibility may be limited
- Really only good for Android Auto / Apple CarPlay, but updates are likely to break the radio
- I couldn't find a native way to output to 4 distinct channels like you would find on a traditional headunit
- Expensive Components (Around $100 for just the screen)

## Idea 2
Regular Single Din Headunit with Android

### Pros
- Ready 2 Go. Little Setup Required
- Many options from trustworthy brands
- Many cheap options if wanted

### Cons
- Single Din options limited
- Gotta hope it fits, S2000 is very particular
- Very cheap or very expensive. No middle ground
- Chinese Units are jank
- Known brands again, may not fit
- Weak specs for the price


## Idea 3
Shallow Mount single din headunit without a screen for the audio capabilities. An android device for the interface.

### Pros
- Can get a cheap tablet (with better specs than an expensive touchscreen radio)
- Android offers tons of customizability
- Custom ROMs can fill the gap where android support ends
- All of my regular apps can be used (Including Netflix, Spotify, and GrayJay)
- 4G connection

### Cons
- Potential Battery Swelling
- Managing Battery Life (especially when parked for prolonged periods) [[Software#Tasker|See how I manage it in software]]
- No Android Auto support (not that you would need it)
- Cannot control radio functions like fader, EQ, and crossover.
