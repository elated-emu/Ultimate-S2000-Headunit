# Rule 1 - No Google
I respectfully decline Google's Privacy Policy, and refuse to have my data mined. By "No Google" I really mean no big tech companies that have an incentive to gather data and build "Consumer Reports"

Proprietary Software is okay if it does not require internet.
This rules out the most common touchscreen head units, and even many Raspberry PI projects like CrankShaft and OpenAuto.

This also rules out many Chinese headunits like the Joying 8". I cannot trust that these closed source devices are not just sending my data to China. 
# Rule 2 - No Jank
Software should be elegant to look at and use. The interface should be simple, yet powerful.

# Rule 3 - EQ, Fader, Crossover, etc.
Full Audio Processing capabilities. I do not want to sacrifice control over my speaker's frequency range and output. I have 5.25" speakers behind the headrest that need to have a lower output to match the output of the door speakers.

I have an external amp that can do this, but I change these settings depending on the song. Stopping would be very inconvenient.

# Rule 4 - Mobile Interface
Be able to control music from my phone as well as from the radio itself.

I want to be able to load songs from my phone and play them on the radio. I don't want to *need* to type into the radio. But I also want a passenger to be able to type into the radio if they want to change the song.

# Rule 5 - Steering Wheel Controls
Steering Wheel Controls should be fully functional.

I use these very frequently.

# Rule 6 - Affordable
Reasonable price range (Less than $400, but preferably somewhere around $200)

# Rule 7 - Navigation
I need to be able to have some sort of maps. I don't want to rely on my phone [[Software#Navigation Software - OsmAnd|See OsmAnd]]
