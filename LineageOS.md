Now we can choose to install a new OS onto our [[Tablet]]


LineageOS is a custom ROM for Android Devices. We want to replace Samsung's version of Android because it is very sluggish and has poor battery life.

This part is *technically* optional, but the experience would suffer.

Do not follow this guide if your model number doesn't match. 
You **WILL** brick your device.

# LineageOS Experience
You can do some more research but I will give a quick rundown here:

Android is Open Source software maintained by Google.

Manufacturers will use Android and modify it's code, often leading to worse performance.

Lineage OS's goal is to provide a stable version of Android that has as few modifications as possible, allowing it to be very quick.

We want as few features as possible, because we will be adding them ourselves with our own apps. We shouldn't be fighting a device that wants to do its own thing.
