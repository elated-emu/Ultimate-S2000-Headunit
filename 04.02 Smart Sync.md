# Overview
Smart Sync gives your phone or tablet an interface for your headunit. It actually works well as a full replacement. You will have access to all of the headunit's features from the screen.

# Features
1. 31 Band EQ
2. Fader
3. Crossover
4. Balance
5. High Pass Filter
6. Low Pass Filter
7. Volume Control
8. Music Integration










First of all, Smart Sync is an amazing app developed by Pioneer. No idea why they created it to be honest. Not really sure what problem this solves for the average person, but it is very important for our highly specific use case. ***Thank you**

> I think they developed it for the [Pioneer SPH-10BT](https://usa.pioneer/products/sph-10bt) which doesn't have a volume knob, so it might be because people might have a hard time changing the settings without an app?

You can control every possible setting on the headunit, and even settings that are inaccessible from the headunit (such as 31 band EQ).
